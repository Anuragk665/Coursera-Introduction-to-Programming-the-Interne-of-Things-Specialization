The OSI model is composed of different layers that contains different protocols.


The TCP protocol (Transmission Control Protocol) is a protocol that is used in the the transport layer. It mainly puts the data in segments that will be sent from the reciever to the sender. (There is also UDP, but it is faster than TCP)


The IP protocol (Internet Protocol) is a protocol that is used in the network layer, the final layer of the OSI model. It attaches between the sender and the reciever, who are identified by an IP address, and obviously connected to the internet.
